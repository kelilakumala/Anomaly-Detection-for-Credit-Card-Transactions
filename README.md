# Anomaly-Detection-for-Credit-Card-Transactions
Identifying anomalies on credit card transaction datasets

This project follows the steps of Knowledge Discover Process (KDD):
1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing
   - we integrated two different datasets from Kaggle and conducted data cleaning for unrelated/insignificant features
   - data transformation was conducted through encoding 
   - exploratory data analysis was conducted to find the correlation and relevance of each feature in the combined dataset
2. Data Mining
   - three different machine learning models were utilized to find anomalies in the dataset: Isolation Forest, SVM, and K-Means Clustering
3. Model Evaluation
   - the confusion matrix was used to evaluate the model
   - accuracy and recall score are calculated for each model to decide which performs the best
4. Knowledge Presentation
   - our findings were presented in a research paper (attached)
